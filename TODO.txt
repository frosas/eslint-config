## should 

- upgrade to eslint 9
  - once eslint-plugin-react supports it
    - track progress in https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/issues/3699
- fix frosasConfig type not being correct
  - it has to do with the import("typescript-eslint/node_modules/@typescript-eslint/utils/dist/ts-eslint") path not being correct

## could

- vscode setup
- include https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn
  - it may be quite opinionated, so maybe just a subset of it
  - some interesting ones
    - https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/blob/main/docs/rules/expiring-todo-comments.md
